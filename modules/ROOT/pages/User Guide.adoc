== Getting started

After installing and opening G HUB, you are presented with a homepage.

image::homepage.bmp[A screenshot of the homepage with features numbered left-to-right.]

A detailed overview of the homepage:

1. Navigation pane.
This pane allows you to open a list of apps/games, change the G HUB settings, and open community resources.

2. Your Gear.
All your Logitech G devices are shown here.
If you have several devices connected, use the arrows on each side to scroll.
+
TIP: Click on the image of a device to change its <<dpi, DPI>>, <<assignments, assignments>>, or lighting.
+
3. On-board Memory Mode.
You can store settings directly on your device without connecting to G HUB.
Note that this limits some macro and integration assignments.

4. Device Settings.
Here, you can set up a Bluetooth connection or make changes to each of [underline]#five# On-board Memory slots.

5. Profiles.
G HUB automatically creates a profile for each game/app it detects.
+
NOTE: The lock icon:lock[] to the left of the profile name indicates that the current profile is [underline]#persistent#, meaning it will remain active regardless of what app is open.+ 
You can set up a persistent profile in the G HUB settings.
+
6. View buttons.
Use these to switch the display of your Gear list.

7. Logi ID button.
Opens the login page in your web browser where you can connect your existing Logi ID or create a new one.

== Setting up DPI sensitivity [[dpi]]  
Access the DPI settings tab by selecting the image of your mouse.

image::User Guide\dpisettings.bmp[A screenshot of the DPI settings, with features numbered left-to-right.]

A detailed overview of the DPI settings:

1. A list of DPI speeds.
Your current speed is underlined.

2. Persistent profile button.
Select the lock icon:unlock-alt[] to enable DPI persistent profile, meaning the DPI settings will not change upon switching apps.
If you wish to have different DPI settings for each game/app, enable per-profile DPI by selecting the lock icon icon:lock[] again.
+
3. The DPI slider.
You can assign up to five DPI speeds by clicking anywhere on the slider.
To delete a speed, drag the respective circle icon:circle[] off the slider.
+
*NOTE*: The [blue]#*DPI Shift*# speed is represented by the icon:square[] diamond icon.
You can assign a button to activate DPI Shift by selecting the plus icon icon:plus-square[] on the left pane.
+
// There is no rhombus/diamond icon in FontAwesome v4. If it needs to be included for publishing, the other icons must be downloaded and converted to :icons:image mode.

4. The DPI Shift assignment button.
To assign the DPI Shift speed, select a speed and press the white icon:square[] diamond button on top.


== Settings assignments for each profile [[assignments]]
Access the assignment settings tab by clicking on the image of your mouse and opening the profiles menu using the plus button icon:plus-square[].

image::User Guide\assignments.bmp[A screenshot of the assignments settings, with features numbered left-to-right.]

A detailed overview of the profile settings:

1. List of available assignments.
For each tab, use the search bar icon:search[] to find an assignment.
The tabs are:
... Commands.
Editing, navigation, and OS-specific shortcuts.
... Keys.
Single buttons that can be found on a typical keyboard.
... Actions.
Commands for supported third party integrations: Overwolf, Streamlabs Desktop, Discord, and OBS.
... Macros.
Customizable sequences of events or commands.
- See <<macros, "Making your own macros">> to learn how to configure macros and some useful suggestions.
... System.
Mouse commands are found here, as well as media, editing, and audio hotkeys.
Includes the option to launch an application.

2. Persistent profile button.
Select the lock icon icon:unlock-alt[] to toggle the persistent profile, meaning the assignments will not change upon switching apps.
To switch between different assignments for each game/app, enable per-profile DPI by selecting the lock icon icon:lock[] again.

3. The assignments view.
To add an assignment, drag it from the left pane onto the desired button.
To delete an assignment or revert back to default, select the circle icon icon:circle[] next to a button.

4. View buttons.
If your mouse has side buttons, select *View 2* to display the side view.

5. G-Shift switch.
[blue]#*G-Shift*# is used to create a second set of assignments for a profile, doubling the number of buttons your mouse has.
Toggle the switch to display the G-Shift assignments.
To use the secondary assignments, assign the G-Shift command under System>Device to a button.

WARNING: If you remap the left mouse button to anything other than *Primary Click*, you will be unable to left-click.
To revert this assignment, use a mousepad, connect a different mouse, or follow <<switchLeftClick, these instructions to switch your primary and secondary buttons.>>

== Making your own macros [[macros]] 

Within the macro editor, there are three types of basic macros:

- No repeat
- Repeat while holding
- Toggle

As well as the Sequence macros, which combine the three basic types.

=== How to use the macro editor

- To add an action, such as a keystroke or a text string, select the plus button icon:plus-square[].
To cancel, select the X button icon:window-close[]. +
- To delete an action, select it and press kbd:[Backspace] or kbd:[Delete]. +
- To select multiple actions, use kbd:[Shift+Click] or press kbd:[Ctrl+A] to select all.

Inside the editor, you have options to rename the macro and change its color.

The options to use a standard 50ms delay, and to display the release of a key are enabled by default:

- To record the timing of the keys as you press them, or to use custom delays, clear the *Use standard delays* checkbox.
1 second = 1000 ms.
- To display only when a key is pressed (but not released), clear the *Show key down/key up* checkbox.
This is useful when programming shortcuts such as kbd:[Ctrl+C].

image::User Guide/macroeditor.bmp[]

=== No repeat

These macros play [underline]#once# after the macro key is pressed.

- For productivity, this type of macro are best used for in-app shortcuts.
- For gaming, they can be used to assign keys or combinations of keys that require precise timings.

.Example No Repeat macro: 
[caption=""]
[example]
Example: "Italicize" is a simple No Repeat macro that plays kbd:[Ctrl+I], the shortcut to make text italic in a text editor.
This lets the user highlight certain words without taking a hand off the mouse.

image::User Guide/productivity.bmp[]

=== Repeat while holding

These macros loop continuously [underline]#while# the macro key is pressed.

- For productivity, they can be useful for inputting text or repeating actions.
- For gaming, Repeat macros can be useful when button-mashing is required, or during quick-time events.

.Example Repeat macro: 
[caption=""]
[example]
"Type #" is a Repeat macro that types the pound sign after a slight delay.
Macros like this can be useful in text editing, like in the Markdown language where the number of # signs represents a heading.

image::User Guide\productivity2.bmp[]

=== Toggle  

These macros loop continuously until the macro key is [underline]#pressed again#.

- For productivity, Toggle macros can be used to hold down keys like kbd:[Ctrl].
This can be useful for inputting key chords, or for users with limited mobility.
- For gaming, they can be useful to use an ability right after a cooldown, or holding down keys like kbd:[Shift] for games which don't allow to toggle running.

.Example Toggle macro: 
[caption=""]
[example]
"Hold Ctrl" is a Toggle macro that simply holds down the kbd:[Ctrl] key until it's pressed again.
Certain code editors use shortcut combinations such as kbd:[Ctrl+K] kbd:[Ctrl+U] to format code.
With this macro, you can avoid using both hands or stretching to reach the control key.

image::User Guide\productivity3.bmp[]

=== Sequence  

Sequence macros combine all the other types.
[underline]#Three separate macros# play upon pressing the macro key, while holding it down, and upon release.

.Example Sequence macro 
[caption=""]
[example]
"Alt Tab and Hold" is a Sequence macro that brings up the Windows task switcher, which can otherwise be done by pressing kbd:[Alt+Tab] and holding down kbd:[Alt].
This lets the user choose a specific window to open instead of cycling through every option.

== Backing up and restoring settings  

To manually save G Hub application settings, follow these steps:

. Exit G HUB by right-clicking on it in the system tray and selecting *Quit*.
+
image::systemtray.png[]
+
. Navigate to `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local`
+
. Copy the `LGHUB` folder to a safe place on your computer, like the Desktop.

. When installing G HUB again, or on a new device, replace the existing `LGHUB` folder in `AppData\Local` with the backed up folder.

== On-board memory mode 

The on-board memory mode lets you store a profile's settings directly on the device.
However, using this mode disables integrations and custom-made macros.

- To turn on the on-board memory mode, use the associated button under your device's image.

image::User Guide\device_buttons.png[]

- To configure the on-board memory mode and upload up to 5 profiles to your device, go into the device settings.

=== Onboard Memory Manager

The Onboard Memory Manager is a separate utility from Logitech.
It's not a direct replacement for G HUB, but a useful tool for configuring the on-board memory of your mouse.

image::User Guide\onboardmemory_window.png[]

To launch the Onboard Memory Manager, get it from the https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059641133[official download page] and select the right Windows version.
Then, simply launch the .exe file.

== Common issues

=== Accidentally un-assigned left click button [[switchLeftClick]]

If you've assigned another function to the left mouse button without assigning "Primary Click" elsewhere, you will be unable to use G HUB to revert this change.

==== If your keyboard has a numeric pad:

Press kbd:[Alt+Left Shift+Num Lock] to activate MouseKeys and control the pointer with your Num pad:

- The outside number keys are used to move the mouse cursor.

- The kbd:[5] number key is used as the primary click button.

- The kbd:[Insert]/kbd:[0] key is used to hold down primary click.

- The plus key kbd:[+] is used to double-click.

- The Delete key kbd:[Del] is used to release the mouse.

==== If your keyboard doesn't have a numeric pad:

Use the keyboard to switch the primary and secondary mouse buttons: 

TIP: Use kbd:[Tab] and the arrow keys icon:arrows[] to navigate, kbd:[Enter] to open a window, and kbd:[Spacebar] to select a checkbox.
Use kbd:[Alt+Tab] to re-open this guide as you're following the instructions.

. Open Mouse Properties by pressing the Windows key icon:windows[], then typing in "Control Panel" and pressing kbd:[Enter].
In the search box, type "mouse", and select "Change mouse settings".

. Select the Buttons tab, and then navigate to the `Switch primary and secondary buttons` checkbox.
Press kbd:[Spacebar] to select the checkbox.

. Select `Apply`, then `Ok`.

You have now swapped the primary click function to the right mouse button, and can use it to revert your changes in G HUB.
